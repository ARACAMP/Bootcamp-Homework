The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

We will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

The daa resources:
* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - 

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - 


We created a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
